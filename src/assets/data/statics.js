    //     'His breakthrough came after his reworks of Flume and Childish Gambino effortlessly floated into Hype Machine’ s top 5 most popular charts, and he has since become an in -demand remixer, appearing on official releases by ZHU, SAFIA, Indian Summer and more.\n' +
    //     'Beyond his remix capabilities, Akouo has proven his worth as an artist with his debut EP, "Mesa" climbing straight to #1 on iTunes’ electronic albums chart upon release. Lead by the infectious single "Last Time", "Mesa" is a soulful, downtempo journey into the post-hip-hop inspired world of Akouo, featuring spaced out synths, cleverly crafted percussion, and brilliant hooks sung by himself.\n' +
    //     '"Maybe you caught his startling productions on the radio, or even found yourself holding your phone aloft in the middle of a dancefloor trying to Shazam what on earth he’s spinning. It could have been any of these things, because at this very moment Akouo is probably appearing on all three, carving out a reputation as one of the hardest working electronic producers in Australia." – THUMP\n' +

    //     '"’Last Time’ is a shimmering, head-nod inducing slice of future beat laced with an airy, sparse vocal hook that keeps the song from floating off into the slipstream of noodling Soundcloud production." – Pigeons & Planes\n' +
    //     '"Akouo is like the little devil that pops up on the shoulder of a tune and encourages it to do naughty things." – Stoney Roads',

      bio: `Somehwere on the salty fringes of Sydney’s northern beaches, Charlie, aka Bajillionaire, is brewing certified ear candy with a zesty kick.
        Bubbling over with energy and a determinedly DIY approach to tune-making, Charlie builds his beats from the ground up, deliberately allowing for rough edges. The result is light, tropical melodies paired with chunky drops, all pulsing over a future-bass undercurrent; it’s this sound that’s had ears perking across the globe since his debut in 2016.
        Charlie’s success first took shape online, with high profile playlist inclusions and a strong Spotify charting ensuring early creations like ‘Been Gone’ and ‘Not Enough’ reached the ears of hundreds of thousands worldwide. His reach suddenly exploding, Bajillionaire caught the attention of Triple J selectors with 2018 single ‘Goin On’.
        A saxophone player since childhood, Charlie developed a strong grasp on music theory early on, which helped him find his feet in the production scene alone. These days his music draws on anyone from Tyler The Creator to Maroon 5, Louis The Child, and even Charlie’s toughest but fairest critic—his mum. And in case you didn’t pick it up from the tongue-in-cheek moniker, Bajillionaire takes his music far more seriously than himself.
        His penchant for DIY-production and minimalism is not only reflected in his music, but also in his live sets. This year, Bajillionaire scored his first major gig booking at Sydney’s iconic Ivy club, sharing the bill with Northeast Party House, Wafia, E^st and SACHI. Flanked by his vocalist friends, Bajillionaire tore the crowd a new one - and whetted his appetite for a bigger live set up.
        Whether it’s bus trip, road trip, barbecue or bedroom, Bajillionaire will hook you and hold you, soundtracking those introspective in-between moments with signature style.`,

He lures you in with his cheeky vibe, inspires you with a positive skew and just as you’re smiling along  he’ll pack you with a punch to the guts rapping about confronting subjects in a manner so lightly you kinda feel confused.
    //     The provocative film clip accompanying his debut track 9 times out of 10 was filmed at the Castlemaine Gaol, has a cameo appearance by his best mate Baker Boy and comes with the blessings of ex-Don Dale detainee Dylan Voller. "The fact that Dallas and the mob at Grand Trine bothered to talk to me before making this clip, and for Dallas and them to put their necks on the line is very powerful for us young fellas. We’re really grateful.  It shows us they care about us and our future," says Dylan Voller
    //     At a young age Dallas Woods developed the uncanny ability to find humour in the most unlikely places. Poverty, suicide, abuses of all kinds are a common theme in his life yet its relentless exposure has provided him with the mettle to cut-through society’s demons so he can apply words to his tsunami of feelings and thoughts. Dallas writes with a wealth of humility, knowledge and experience; it’s his coping mechanism.
    //     Debut track 9 times out of 10 raps about the power-trip police have in remote Aboriginal communities and how their overt presence is a normal occurrence to him and the residents living there. Dallas Woods raps with clever humour about the stigma of being young, black and breaking the cycle of oppression from within community.`,

      bio: 'Yahtzel first rose to prominence with his debut single Girls in 2013. The track gained major hype within the Australian indie-dance scene – so much that it was featured in Flume’s BBC6 Radio Mix as well as tight upload on Majestic Casual. Proving his success wasn’t by chance, Yahtzel’s follow-up single High With Me harvested over 13 million plays since TheSoundYouNeed posted it in 2013 as well as being named as one of InTheMix’s top tracks of the year. This catapulted him on a 26-stop Australasian tour that included sets at Australian boutique tastemaker festivals including Listen Out, Falls Festival, Your Paradise (Fiji) as well as jumping on the international stages of Holy Ship! and national touring support for ODESZA.\n' +
        'Aside from his phenomenal solo career, Yahtzel is also known as one half of the OWSLA and Gold - Accredited(ARIA) duo Carmada.Teaming up with mate L D R U, Carmada have achieved extraordinary success since their formation in 2014, gaining nods from the likes of Skrillex and Diplo, a #1 debut on iTunes AU, a # 41 finish for Maybe in the triple j Hottest 100 and sets at festivals across the globe from Ultra Miami, HARD Summer, Stereosonic to Holy Ship!.',

      bio: `Australian electronic-soul duo YesYou present latest compelling single titled “Everybody’s Got To Learn Sometimes” set for release on September 21st via Onelove.  Originally written by English writer James Warren for 80’s act The Korgis and famously later covered by Beck for ‘Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’.  YesYou garnered an impressive 10 million collective streams to date as well as receving airplay on BBC 1’s Pete Tong and Australian radio station Triple J and garnering support from renowned tastemaker publications Consequence of Sound, Clash Mag, The Line Of Best Fit and Indie Shuffle.
        Upon exploring their own intuitive, distinctive nostalgia drenched brand of electronic, RnB and soul inspired music, YesYou have also expanded on their journey thus far by collaborating or working closely with artists such as Jordan Rakei (Ninja Tune), Noah Slee (Majestic Casual), Michael Marshall (Timex Social Club) and Damon Trueitt (FKJ, Todd Edwards) among many others, furthering their creative and unique palette of heart-warming composition and stylistic production into its lusciously evolved state it stands for today.
        Influenced by a wide-range of artists from Moby to Pretty Lights, and Fatboy Slim to Maribou State - YesYou’s signature atmospheric, and texture-based brand of indie-pop inspired electronic-RnB swims in delicate timbre, rendering the duo reminiscent of acts such as Romare or Ross From Friends with their ability to mix indie-danceable gems and funk-laden rhythms alongside multifaceted vocal techniques.`,

      bio: `Bright eyed 5 piece melodic groove machine The Zilzies spent 2017 solidifying what they started the year before, cementing themselves as one of the hottest new talents in the country, and earning the respect of many a fellow crowd pleasing act. With a national tour and sold out shows under their belt, the boys are looking to kick off the cycle all over again with a follow up single in the works for release in mid 2018.
        The group’s first E.P. - 'Shell City', produced by Dylan Adams (Sticky Fingers, DMA'S) was released in 2017, and garnered rave reviews from both independent blogs and Triple j alike. Taking influence from The Strokes, Tame Impala, Frank Ocean, Pink Floyd, Gang of Youths and SpongeBob SquarePants, and Backed up with TWO sold out single and E.P. launch shows at Wollongong’s 'Rad' - the record oozes potential. Sparse yet intricate instrumentation with lyrics Telling stories of simplistic wisdom culminate in a thought provoking, reflective, and highly danceable Five-Track Release.
        Having already shared the stage with fellow Australian acts Saskwatch, Jebediah, Lime Cordiale, The VANNS, and Tyne-James Organ, the band are showing no signs of collecting less accolades for the rest of the year.`,
