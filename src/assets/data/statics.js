      bio: `After blazing into the hearts and minds of the international music community with a modernized twist on low-end house and indebted four-to-the-floor, Amine Edge & DANCE look set to continue their meteoric rise with another string of sell out shows and prime-time festival slots in 2017.
Hailing from Southern France, Amine Edge & DANCE have built their own musical empire, drawing inspiration from early House, Phili Soul, Hip-Hop and everything in between. The men from Marseille have set about developing their own signature sound and are starting to show their true talent and versatility as producers. The pair recently released the, ‘FCK UR OPINION’ EP via independent label Desolat, helmed by the legendary Loco Dice, which featured three monster techno tracks oozing hard bass and showcasing another slightly darker side of the AE&D sound. 2017 will see a slew of new singles including the landmark 50th release on their burgeoning label CUFF, a collaboration with velvet vocalist SerGy that has already garnered support from Pete Tong at Radio 1 and beyond.
In 2016, the globe-trotting duo capped another phenomenal year by being crowned winners of the “Bass” category at the 2016 DJ Awards. To become the cream of the sub-laden crop, Amine Edge & DANCE had to fend off the challenge of an internationally renowned group of bass-heavy heavyweights including Andy C, Chase and Status, Hannah Wants, DJ EZ and more. This was testament to their longevity and musical evolution, from bass-heavy hip-hop infused up-starts to heavyweight headline act.`,

      bio: `Somehwere on the salty fringes of Sydney’s northern beaches, Charlie, aka Bajillionaire, is brewing certified ear candy with a zesty kick.
        Bubbling over with energy and a determinedly DIY approach to tune-making, Charlie builds his beats from the ground up, deliberately allowing for rough edges. The result is light, tropical melodies paired with chunky drops, all pulsing over a future-bass undercurrent; it’s this sound that’s had ears perking across the globe since his debut in 2016.
        Charlie’s success first took shape online, with high profile playlist inclusions and a strong Spotify charting ensuring early creations like ‘Been Gone’ and ‘Not Enough’ reached the ears of hundreds of thousands worldwide. His reach suddenly exploding, Bajillionaire caught the attention of Triple J selectors with 2018 single ‘Goin On’.
        A saxophone player since childhood, Charlie developed a strong grasp on music theory early on, which helped him find his feet in the production scene alone. These days his music draws on anyone from Tyler The Creator to Maroon 5, Louis The Child, and even Charlie’s toughest but fairest critic—his mum. And in case you didn’t pick it up from the tongue-in-cheek moniker, Bajillionaire takes his music far more seriously than himself.
        His penchant for DIY-production and minimalism is not only reflected in his music, but also in his live sets. This year, Bajillionaire scored his first major gig booking at Sydney’s iconic Ivy club, sharing the bill with Northeast Party House, Wafia, E^st and SACHI. Flanked by his vocalist friends, Bajillionaire tore the crowd a new one - and whetted his appetite for a bigger live set up.
        Whether it’s bus trip, road trip, barbecue or bedroom, Bajillionaire will hook you and hold you, soundtracking those introspective in-between moments with signature style.`,

From Leeds to Hannover to Los Angeles, this Gin Sippin’tower of hair has spent time soaking it all in. Now in his prime, with total mastery of the nobs and dials, Billy Kenny is raging all over the world. With absolutely no regard for convention, every sound he designs in the studio is a unique blend of everywhere he’s touched. Between shows and even at his own shows, you can often find Mr. Kenny sharing your dance floor and banging his head right alongside you and your crew when he’s not playing. Juan could say he likes to have his share of fun and that FOMO is NOT an option. 
As co­owner of the highly respected Germany­based This Ain’t Bristol, Billy is also responsible for scouting many of the hits that the record label has disseminated. His high energy mixing, sampling, and scratching with four CDJ’s is as thrilling to see as it is to hear. Even a bathroom break during a Billy Kenny set is a challenge as you won’t want to miss a single transition. This prolific British producer has also created a reputation for topping the charts, grabbing him quite a few accolades from the likes of  Beatport, the BMA’s, and more. This is just the start of your relationship with Billy Kenny and we have no doubt that the sex is fantastic.`,

      bio: `Chase Zera has been spreading her talents across the performing arts scene since the age of six. She grew up excelling in every dance genre from commercial jazz to hip-hop and cabaret. She then began singing and writing her own original material at the age of thirteen as well as learning the piano to refine her craft.
Chase Zera was accepted into the Australian Institute of Music and studied Composition and Audio Engineering as well as attending Ableton Live School where she learned the basics of music production. This helped spark her passion for pop and electronic music and allowed her to experiment and find her signature brooding, pop-house sound.
She has also collaborated in writing and production with various artists such as Xavier Dunn, Stu Turner from Set Mo, Commandeur, Bajillionaire & GANZ.
Chase Zera's sound can be described as upbeat and electrifying, with the addition of her airy vocals, consistent with a distinct vibrato. Her live shows are packed with high energy as Chase showcases powerful, bold choreography alongside her dancers.
‘Clovers’, the debut single by Chase Zera was premiered by Purple Sneakers on 1st March 2019. ‘Clovers’ made its mark on Spotify’s prestigious ‘New Music Fridays’, ‘House Party’, ‘Office Stereo’ and ‘Pop Edge’ playlists. The single was also played on Declan Byrne’s ‘Home and Hosed’ on Triple J and added to the Triple J Unearthed weekly podcast, charting on Triple J Unearthed in its first week of upload. 
“It’s a pop anthem that works hard to showcase her songwriting abilities, vocal prowess and production skill. The complexities of the lyrical content are reflected very aptly in the hard-hitting production, and the slick sheen of this one comes through with years of experience.” – Purple Sneakers.`,

Doorly cut his teeth in his native Huddersfield, running his own after hours warehouse party and booking the likes Armand Van Helden, Fatboy Slim, 2 Many DJs and eventually Pete Tong, who was so impressed by his ability behind the decks that he offered him a Live Radio 1 Essential Mix direct from the club. Following this seal of approval, Doorlys gig schedule took on a life of its own, with DJing in Time Square New York, and every major festival plus touring regularly alongside Fatboy Slim & Soulwax just some of the highlights. 
At the same time as touring, Doorly was working hard honing his craft in the studio, establishing himself as a versatile, in-demand producer. Remix work for an enviable list of A-list acts followed, with imaginative reworkings of tracks from Kanye West, The Prodigy, Claude Vonstroke, Groove Armada and Basement Jaxx setting Doorly on a different creative level to many of his peers`,

A while passed and they had a few bands, but then decided to be serious, real serious. they met marcus at the beach one day, at the boat ramp, and knew that he played bass and he was noticeable cuz of a huge scar going down where his heart is. plus he was just chilling a lot and going to AIM a bit so it was easy to nab him. Taras met toms sister in india, and she said her brother wanted to learn some piano, so he taught him some piano, but he (tom) was a sick drummer as well so they got him in as well cuz taras promised that he'd take him in if he ever started a band (it wasnt a movie-like promise, it was just tom was a real quick learner and could play heaps of instruments so it was a no brainer). angus came last, he was a friend of toms, and he was pretty much in when he helped the band cover that earth wind and fire song that goes "and gliiiiiiideeee like a seven-forty-seven" (their song titles always are jumbled in my mind).`,

      bio: `At 16 years old with 5 years of music production under his belt already, it is evident that Perto is ready to establish himself in the scene for many years to come. Rubbing shoulders with some of music's elite, he has garnered support from industry heavyweights such as DIPLO, POST MALONE, TIMBALAND, CARNAGE, ALISON WONDERLAND, PEKING DUK, JAUZ, QUIX & GRAVES to name only a few.
        His early releases turned plenty of heads amongst his peers, including Enschway who was a collaborator on their recent tune 'Lose It' released via Sweat It Out. His breakout year has also seen him release official remixes for both FLOSSTRADAMUS & VALENTINO KHAN, amassing over 1 MILLION PLAYS as well as a collection of bootlegs which encapsulate the electronic/hip hop infused sound that he is becoming known for.
        The remainder of 2018 is looking bright for the youngster with his Debut tour to be announced as well as collaborations with some of the world's most exciting talent.`,

      bio: `In the past few years, Prok & Fitch have cemented their position as one of the most respected and successful DJ/productions outfits in electronic music. Regularly cited as one of Beatport’s highest selling artists annually – with 2016’s Green Velvet collab ‘Sheeple’ remaining at No.1 for an impressive 10 weeks  – their music strikes an appealing balance between melodic intricacy and dance floor heft. The success of their music and prowess behind the decks has lead to regular appearances at many of the world’s most renowned venues and festivals. 
Hailing from the UK’s south coast, Ben Prok and James Fitch shared a mutual love of house music that led to them working together on debut release ‘Outro Lugar’, a remake of the Salomé de Bahia original. These early studio sessions formed the basis of the tough, groove-led sound with which that went on to make their names, eventually becoming one of the UK’s most celebrated proponents of Tech House. 
Prok & Fitch fast established themselves as both prolific and with the talent to match their output, working with highly credible labels such a Relief, Toolroom, Suara and Stereo. Talent like this didn’t go unnoticed for long, leading to collaborations with the likes of Green Velvet, Dosem, Dajae and Mark Knight on various projects in the last couple of years. 
Prok & Fitch’s music also finds consistent support across Radio One’s full spectrum of dance shows; notably Pete Tong & Annie Mac airing pretty much everything that comes from their Brighton studio, and DJ’s like Nic Fanciulli, Carl Cox, Joris Voorn, Marco Carola, Matthias Tanzmann and more all professing to heavy rotation of their addictive club cuts in their sets. 
This hype and consistency has earned them the respect to grace some of the finest dance floors and festivals in the world including BPM Mexico, Green Valley Brazil, Space and Amnesia Ibiza, Womb Tokyo, Exchange LA, Heart Miami, Ultra Music Festival, EDC, Sunburn & more.
"We're in the best place we've ever been with our sound, we're making the music we love and it's effortless, it fuels our passion for house and techno, a passion that we've carried since day one."`,

      bio: `Australian electronic-soul duo YesYou present latest compelling single titled “Everybody’s Got To Learn Sometimes” set for release on September 21st via Onelove.  Originally written by English writer James Warren for 80’s act The Korgis and famously later covered by Beck for ‘Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’.  YesYou garnered an impressive 10 million collective streams to date as well as receving airplay on BBC 1’s Pete Tong and Australian radio station Triple J and garnering support from renowned tastemaker publications Consequence of Sound, Clash Mag, The Line Of Best Fit and Indie Shuffle.
        Upon exploring their own intuitive, distinctive nostalgia drenched brand of electronic, RnB and soul inspired music, YesYou have also expanded on their journey thus far by collaborating or working closely with artists such as Jordan Rakei (Ninja Tune), Noah Slee (Majestic Casual), Michael Marshall (Timex Social Club) and Damon Trueitt (FKJ, Todd Edwards) among many others, furthering their creative and unique palette of heart-warming composition and stylistic production into its lusciously evolved state it stands for today.
        Influenced by a wide-range of artists from Moby to Pretty Lights, and Fatboy Slim to Maribou State - YesYou’s signature atmospheric, and texture-based brand of indie-pop inspired electronic-RnB swims in delicate timbre, rendering the duo reminiscent of acts such as Romare or Ross From Friends with their ability to mix indie-danceable gems and funk-laden rhythms alongside multifaceted vocal techniques.`,

      bio: `Bright eyed 5 piece melodic groove machine The Zilzies spent 2017 solidifying what they started the year before, cementing themselves as one of the hottest new talents in the country, and earning the respect of many a fellow crowd pleasing act. With a national tour and sold out shows under their belt, the boys are looking to kick off the cycle all over again with a follow up single in the works for release in mid 2018.
        The group’s first E.P. - 'Shell City', produced by Dylan Adams (Sticky Fingers, DMA'S) was released in 2017, and garnered rave reviews from both independent blogs and Triple j alike. Taking influence from The Strokes, Tame Impala, Frank Ocean, Pink Floyd, Gang of Youths and SpongeBob SquarePants, and Backed up with TWO sold out single and E.P. launch shows at Wollongong’s 'Rad' - the record oozes potential. Sparse yet intricate instrumentation with lyrics Telling stories of simplistic wisdom culminate in a thought provoking, reflective, and highly danceable Five-Track Release.
        Having already shared the stage with fellow Australian acts Saskwatch, Jebediah, Lime Cordiale, The VANNS, and Tyne-James Organ, the band are showing no signs of collecting less accolades for the rest of the year.`,
