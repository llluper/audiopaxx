      bio: 'Launceston, Tasmania-based producer Akouo (ah-koo-oh) was locally recognized as a beatmaker and DJ in Australia’s underground hip-hop scene before gaining national and worldwide attention as a solo act in 2013.\n' +
        'His breakthrough came after his reworks of Flume and Childish Gambino effortlessly floated into Hype Machine’ s top 5 most popular charts, and he has since become an in -demand remixer, appearing on official releases by ZHU, SAFIA, Indian Summer and more.\n' +
        'Beyond his remix capabilities, Akouo has proven his worth as an artist with his debut EP, “Mesa” climbing straight to #1 on iTunes’ electronic albums chart upon release. Lead by the infectious single “Last Time”, “Mesa” is a soulful, downtempo journey into the post-hip-hop inspired world of Akouo, featuring spaced out synths, cleverly crafted percussion, and brilliant hooks sung by himself.\n' +
        '“Maybe you caught his startling productions on the radio, or even found yourself holding your phone aloft in the middle of a dancefloor trying to Shazam what on earth he’s spinning. It could have been any of these things, because at this very moment Akouo is probably appearing on all three, carving out a reputation as one of the hardest working electronic producers in Australia.” – THUMP\n' +
        '“The Tasmania-based producer combines brilliant reverberance with hip-hop sensibilities in a way that few other can match.” – Kick Kick Snare\n' +
        '“His influences are moody, deep and emotional at times – from Sampha to Drake, you start to get the sense of where he would like to take his career. The type of music he creates is certainly not within the typical electronic production structure.” – DJ Mag Australia\n' +
        '“’Last Time’ is a shimmering, head-nod inducing slice of future beat laced with an airy, sparse vocal hook that keeps the song from floating off into the slipstream of noodling Soundcloud production.” – Pigeons & Planes\n' +
        '“Akouo is like the little devil that pops up on the shoulder of a tune and encourages it to do naughty things.” – Stoney Roads',
